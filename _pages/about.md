I am a senior postdoc in Natural Language Processing at the [Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp), 
[Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/). I coordinate and co-advise InterText: a [large project](https://erc.europa.eu/projects-statistics/science-stories/artificial-intelligence-living-texts) about modeling text as a living object in context. 
We create tasks, datasets, methods and applications for cross-document NLP, edit analysis, and AI for peer reviewing assistance. 
You can follow this research [here](https://intertext.ukp-lab.de/). 
Before that, I worked on computational linguistics, probing and interpretability. 
This journey is described – at length – [here](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/19851/). 

And before that, I studied Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, and worked as an NLP researcher at the Higher School of Economics, in Russia.

Broadly, I am interested in new empirical approaches to AI evaluation, human-AI interaction and collaboration. I like clever applications of AI for scientific work, education, and complex tasks. 
I love cross-disciplinary research. I am interested in responsible and safe AI, and co-lecture a course on Ethics for NLP and AI together with [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp).

Even more broadly, I just find it exciting to be a part of a new, rapidly growing discipline. I wonder how our future science of AI will be. I also like sound design, synthesizers and audiovisual art, but this is a story for another website.
